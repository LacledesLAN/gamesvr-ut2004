# Unreal Tournament 2004 Adrenalin Combos and Special Moves

There are a range of special moves which can be performed by your character under certain circumstances. Some require that you have 100 Adrenalin. Others, like the Dodging moves require that you have the Dodge setting ticked (See In-game Settings section). You can get Adrenalin points through various methods:

* Picking up a red and white adrenalin pill: 3 points
* A Kill: 2 points
* Headshots: 5 points
* The first kill during a round (First Blood): 12 points
* Killing sprees: 12 points

## Adrenalin Combos

Once your Adrenalin reaches 100 points, you will be allowed to perform one of the following special moves, the effects of which will only last for a while. The following key combinations need to be pressed in rapid succession to activate the Adrenalin effect:

* Speed: Forward, Forward, Forward, Forward
* Regeneration: Back, Back, Back, Back
* Invisibility: Right, Right, Left, Left
* Berserk: Forward, Forward, Back, Back


## Special Moves

These can be performed at any time, but require a fair bit of practice and skill to master. Remember, you need to activate the Dodge setting to use the dodge moves.

* Double Jump: Jump and then press jump again in the arc of the jump
* Dodge: Tap Left, Right, Forward or Back twice quickly
* Dodge Jump: Perform a Dodge, and jump just before you lose your air
* Wall Dodge: Run alongside a wall, jump and quickly Dodge away from it
* Goo Jump: Shoot some goo from the Biorifle, get a shield up using the Shield Gun, jump just when goo explodes (You can also use the shield gun to bounce energy weapons, break your fall and of course block normal weapons.)
* Lift Jump: Jump while on a lift to get an extra boost
* Death from Above: If you jump from a great height and land on someone you'll cause them damage.
